# Visual Vault

## Description of the Project

The challenge of this project was to work collaboratively as a team to create our very first full stack application. Our application is called 'Visual Vault'. It is a website that serves as a platform for developers to show off their project repositories. It also allows users to actively engage with other developers by giving reactions using emojis. This creates a fun environment for developers to interact with each other. Furthermore, we hope that the website can become a platform for employers to view projects of potential candidates. Registered users will be able to add their social profiles including; Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and LinkedIn. This will allow for further interaction between employers and developers beyond Visual Vault. 

## Acceptance Criteria

This full stack application satisfies the following code requirements:

- Application uses a Node and Express back end and uses both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data.
- Application has a folder structure that meets the MVC paradigm and uses Handlebars.js as the template engine.
- Application is backed by a MySQL database with a Sequelize ORM and protects API keys and sensitive information with environment variables.
- Application includes user authentication (express-session and cookies).
- Application uses at least one new library, package, or technology not covered in class.

## User Story

- As a user, I want to be able to sign up for Visual Vault and have my own unique login details.
- As a user, I want to search for another user and be able to view their projects, as well as see the links to their social media profiles that they have chosen to share.
- As a user, I want to share my reaction to a project with the use of emojis.
- As a user, I want to add my own projects and social media accounts to Visual Vault, allowing other users to view my social profiles.
